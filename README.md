# Routing-Lab
This is an interactive script I put together to setup a repetitive in class lab.

## How to:
- Azure portal:
    - Download all files
    - Open Cloud PowerShell Session
    - Upload all files to the same directory
    - Run "./Routing-Lab-Setup.ps1"
    - Answer the questions
    
- Computer with Azure PowerShell module installed:
    - Download all files into the same directory
    - Ensure your Azure Account/Subscription is connected
    - Run "./Routing-Lab-Setup.ps1"
    
#### Notes: 
- Please check your spelling; failure to do so can effect the deployment of some resources. 
- I did not put any error checking in because I am a novice. Use at your own risk.
- Will work better if you use the "Microsoft Azure Sponsorship 2" subscription.
    
### Hope this helps y'all save some time!

If anything doesn't work please let me know.
